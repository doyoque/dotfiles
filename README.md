# Doyoque dotfiles

Enjoy some go-to-paste, straight-forward-use, or just-curious my dotfiles 
(also I easly forget a things).

## Contain what?

- dot vimrc
- dot zshrc
- dot tmux-conf

## How to use?

You either old enough to understand this or you did forget that the world 
is evolving into "just ask GPT". But either way I did respect some individual 
who still aware about "offline" setup so for all of you who still concern 
about that: spread it, educate it, make youself worthful by teaching 'em or 
just guide 'em to be better

## Some Limitation

I think this dotfiles can work in most of the Linux distros. Some distro that 
I usually use up until now are Debian and Arch and it just work right away.

## Can I use on Windows?

Of course not you idiot. FFS I already said "most of the Linux distros".
